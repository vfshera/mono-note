      <h1>About MonoNote</h1>

      <p>
        MonoNote is a space for thoughts on writing, technology, and the tools
        that bridge these worlds. I created this blog to explore how format
        influences content, and how minimal design can enhance focus.

      <h2>About the Author</h2>

      <p>
        I'm a writer and developer who believes in the power of simplicity.
        After years of battling bloated interfaces and distracting features,
        I've returned to the basics: plain text, thoughtful structure, and
        deliberate composition.
