As we begin 2025, I've refined my writing environment to promote focus, flexibility, and creative thinking. Here's my current setup, built around the principles of simplicity and intentionality.

## Hardware

- **Keyboard**: Mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Clear switches for tactile feedback without excessive noise
- **Display**: Single 24" matte display to minimize eye strain
- **Lighting**: Natural light supplemented by warm adjustable desk lamp
- **Secondary device**: E-ink tablet for reading and basic note-taking

## Software

My software stack emphasizes plain text, keyboard control, and minimal distractions:

1. **Writing**: iA Writer for primary composition
   - Monospaced font
   - Focus mode for current sentence
   - Keyboard shortcuts for all common functions

2. **Note-taking**: Obsidian with minimal plugins
   - Bidirectional linking for connected thought
   - Local storage of plain text files
   - Custom CSS for monospaced, minimal interface

3. **Reference management**: Zotero with BetterBibTeX
   - Plain text citations
   - Local PDF storage with annotations
   - Markdown export of notes

4. **Publishing workflow**:
   - Git for version control
   - Static site generator for web publishing
   - Pandoc for format conversion when necessary

## Environment Principles

Beyond specific tools, I've established several principles for my writing environment:

1. **Block potential interruptions**: Notifications disabled, phone in another room
2. **Consistent writing times**: Regular morning sessions before email or messages
3. **Physical comfort**: Proper chair height, keyboard position, and screen distance
4. **Regular breaks**: 5 minutes away from screens every 25 minutes
5. **Separate spaces**: Different locations for different types of writing

What I've found most important isn't the specific tools but the intentionality behind their selection and use. Each element should support, rather than distract from, the thinking and writing process.
