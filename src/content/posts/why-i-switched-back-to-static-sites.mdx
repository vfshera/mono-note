After years of managing complex content management systems and wrestling with database issues, I've returned to a simpler approach for web publishing: the static site.

## The Dynamic Complexity Problem

Modern dynamic websites have introduced several challenges:

1. **Security vulnerabilities**: Content management systems require constant updates
2. **Performance overhead**: Database queries and server-side processing add latency
3. **Dependency nightmares**: Plugins and frameworks create fragile dependency chains
4. **Hosting complexity**: Dynamic sites require more complex and expensive hosting

## The Static Renaissance

Static site generators have evolved dramatically since the early days of the web:

- **Modern build tools**: Fast generation with incremental builds
- **Component-based design**: Reusable elements without server-side processing
- **Markdown content**: Write in plain text with simple formatting
- **Developer experience**: Hot reloading and efficient workflows
- **Deployment simplicity**: CDN distribution with global edge caching

## My Current Approach

My publishing workflow now looks like this:

1. Write content in Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
2. Organize content and assets in a version-controlled repository
3. Generate the site locally to preview changes
4. Push to repository, triggering automatic deployment
5. Serve from global CDN with near-perfect uptime

## The Benefits Realized

Since switching back to static:

- **Site loading speed improved by 300%**
- **Zero security incidents** (compared to monthly issues previously)
- **Hosting costs reduced by 80%**
- **Writing focus improved** without admin distractions
- **Content remains portable** in simple text formats

## When Dynamic Still Makes Sense

Static isn't appropriate for every use case. Dynamic sites still excel for:
- Applications requiring user accounts and personalization
- Sites with complex search requirements
- Platforms needing real-time data processing

For the vast majority of content publishing, however, static generation offers a compelling combination of simplicity, performance, and reliability that's hard to beat.
